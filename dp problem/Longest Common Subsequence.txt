description:
Given two strings S and T, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.


Input

The first line is a string representing the string S(|S|<=5000);
The second line is a string representing the string T(|T|<=5000).

Output

An integer representing the longest common subsequence length.
