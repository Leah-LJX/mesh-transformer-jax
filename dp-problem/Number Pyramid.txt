description:
Consider the digital pyramid shown below. Write a program to calculate the maximum sum of numbers for a path that starts at the highest point and ends anywhere at the bottom
Each step can go to the point on the lower left or the point on the lower right.
7
3 8
8 1 0
2 7 4 4
4 5 2 6 5
In the example above, the paths from 7 to 3 to 8 to 7 to 5 produce the maximum sum 30.

Input

The first line contains R(1<=R<=1000), indicating the number of rows.
The following each line of integers contained in a particular row of the number pyramid. 
All supplied integers are non-negative and not greater than 100.

Output

A single line contains the largest possible sum of that.
